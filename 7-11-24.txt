good progres studying for part 135 checkride
overall great day learning rather than "doing"


- read over part 119 regs
- started to write out interpretation of regs
- reviewed compliance statements and their correlation to reg

moved to llm stuff...
- read thoroughly through "Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation"
	great read, lot to learn here, and even more to implement
- wrote flow diagrams describing paper
	looking to build on these tomorrow
- tried to identify value of using langchain vs "builing custom"
