today felt like hitting a brick wall...
really tried to get some code in but nothing was able to get built

really struggling "mapping" out a design


- read through corrective-rag work and repos
- watched llama-index video on agentic rag
- read about agentic-rag
- tried modeling out architecture of model on paper
- struggled coding...


lessons learned: 
- keep pushing even when at walls
- don't think too big, just get something working again

going at it tomorrow again
