started off to a slow start...extremely distracted
my command line was bothering me so i reinstalled my .zshrc file

then i deleted my background (on a minimalism wave rn)


- organized work environment for purest simplicity
- reviewed last night's work (up and running RAG model FINALLY)
	problem is that its extremley bland so v1.2 is needed
- skimmed "Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation" paper
	valuable info here, going to dive deeper into it tmr and implement
- skimmed "Self-RAG: Learning to Retrieve, Generate and Cirtique thorugh Seld Reflections"
	this was good, a little too much for now, not going to cont. for some time
- looked through repos for inspo developing v1.2 rag model
	idk if i want to use langchain or not (its fast but to high level to understand)
	need advice!!!


looking ahead:
- need to be more efficient in beginning
- start earlier...its too late rn
- how can you A/B test custom app vs langchain without waisting time (think!)
